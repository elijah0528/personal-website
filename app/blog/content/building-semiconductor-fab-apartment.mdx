# Building a Semiconductor Fab in My Apartment

When I first told people I was building a semiconductor fabrication facility in my apartment, most thought I was joking. But here we are, several months later, with a working fab that can produce simple chips right from my living room.


## The Challenge

The semiconductor industry is incredibly complex and capital-intensive. Traditional fabs cost billions of dollars and require cleanroom facilities that rival those used for space missions. So how do you build one in a 500 square foot apartment?

## The Approach

The key insight was to focus on **simplicity over scale**. Instead of trying to replicate Intel's latest 3nm process, I focused on creating larger feature sizes that are still useful for learning and prototyping.

### Equipment Setup

Here's what I managed to fit into my apartment:

- **Photolithography**: A modified UV lamp setup for pattern transfer
- **Etching**: Chemical etching station with proper ventilation
- **Deposition**: Sputtering setup for thin film deposition
- **Inspection**: Modified microscope for quality control

### Process Control Code

To automate the fab processes, I wrote control software in Python:

```python
class FabProcess:
    def __init__(self, temperature=25, pressure=1013):
        self.temperature = temperature  # Celsius
        self.pressure = pressure        # mbar
        self.process_log = []
    
    def photolithography_expose(self, exposure_time=30):
        """UV exposure step for photolithography"""
        print(f"Starting UV exposure for {exposure_time}s")
        self.log_step("UV_EXPOSE", exposure_time)
        
        # Control UV lamp intensity
        uv_intensity = self.calculate_dose(exposure_time)
        return {"status": "complete", "dose": uv_intensity}
    
    def etch_silicon(self, etch_rate=10):
        """Controlled silicon etching process"""
        etch_depth = etch_rate * self.calculate_etch_time()
        self.log_step("ETCH", etch_depth)
        return etch_depth
    
    def log_step(self, process, value):
        import datetime
        timestamp = datetime.datetime.now()
        self.process_log.append({
            "time": timestamp,
            "process": process,
            "value": value,
            "temp": self.temperature,
            "pressure": self.pressure
        })

# Example usage
fab = FabProcess(temperature=23.5, pressure=1012)
result = fab.photolithography_expose(exposure_time=45)
etch_depth = fab.etch_silicon(etch_rate=8.5)
```

This code helped me maintain consistent processing conditions and track each fabrication step.

## Results

After months of iteration, I successfully fabricated my first working transistor. While it's nowhere near commercial standards, it demonstrates the fundamental principles of semiconductor manufacturing.

## What I Learned

Building this fab taught me more about semiconductors than any textbook could. The hands-on experience of dealing with contamination, process variation, and equipment limitations gave me a deep appreciation for the engineering that goes into modern chips.

## Next Steps

The next phase involves scaling up the process and improving yield. I'm also documenting everything to help others who want to build their own educational fabs.
