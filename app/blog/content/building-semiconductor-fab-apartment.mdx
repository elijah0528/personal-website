# Building a Semiconductor Fab in My Apartment

When I first told people I was building a semiconductor fabrication facility in my apartment, most thought I was joking. But here we are, several months later, with a working fab that can produce simple chips right from my living room.

## The Challenge

The semiconductor industry is incredibly complex and capital-intensive. Traditional fabs cost billions of dollars and require cleanroom facilities that rival those used for space missions. So how do you build one in a 500 square foot apartment?

## The Approach

The key insight was to focus on **simplicity over scale**. Instead of trying to replicate Intel's latest 3nm process, I focused on creating larger feature sizes that are still useful for learning and prototyping.

### Equipment Setup

Here's what I managed to fit into my apartment:

- **Photolithography**: A modified UV lamp setup for pattern transfer
- **Etching**: Chemical etching station with proper ventilation
- **Deposition**: Sputtering setup for thin film deposition
- **Inspection**: Modified microscope for quality control

## Results

After months of iteration, I successfully fabricated my first working transistor. While it's nowhere near commercial standards, it demonstrates the fundamental principles of semiconductor manufacturing.

## What I Learned

Building this fab taught me more about semiconductors than any textbook could. The hands-on experience of dealing with contamination, process variation, and equipment limitations gave me a deep appreciation for the engineering that goes into modern chips.

## Next Steps

The next phase involves scaling up the process and improving yield. I'm also documenting everything to help others who want to build their own educational fabs.
