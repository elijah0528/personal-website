# Simulating LA's Population for Transit Optimization

Los Angeles has one of the most complex transportation challenges in the world. With over 4 million people spread across 500 square miles, optimizing transit routes requires understanding human behavior at an unprecedented scale.

## The Vision

What if we could simulate every person in Los Angeles as an individual agent, each with their own daily patterns, preferences, and constraints? This was the ambitious goal behind Skyline.

## Technical Approach

### Agent-Based Modeling

Each of the 4 million residents was modeled as an autonomous agent with:

- **Demographics**: Age, income, family status, work schedule
- **Preferences**: Transportation modes, route preferences, time constraints  
- **Behavior Patterns**: Daily routines, weekend activities, seasonal variations

### Simulation Architecture

The simulation ran on a distributed system capable of processing millions of concurrent agents:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, demographics, location, preferences):
        self.demographics = demographics
        self.home_location = location
        self.work_location = self.assign_workplace()
        self.preferences = preferences
        
    def make_trip_decision(self, time, destination):
        # Complex decision tree considering:
        # - Available transportation options
        # - Time constraints
        # - Cost preferences
        # - Weather conditions
        # - Current traffic state
        pass
```

## Key Insights

### Rush Hour Patterns

The simulation revealed that traditional rush hour assumptions don't hold for LA's diverse economy. Service workers, tech employees, and entertainment industry workers all have different peak times.

### Transit Equity

By modeling income and car ownership, we identified areas where improved public transit would have the highest impact on mobility equity.

### Network Effects

Small changes in one part of the transit network created ripple effects throughout the city, sometimes in unexpected ways.

## Implementation Challenges

### Computational Scale

Simulating 4 million agents in real-time required:
- Custom distributed computing architecture
- Optimized spatial indexing for collision detection
- Efficient message passing between agents

### Data Validation

Ensuring the simulation matched real-world patterns required extensive validation against:
- Traffic sensors
- Transit ridership data
- Mobile phone movement patterns
- Census demographic data

## Results

The simulation successfully identified several transit improvements that could reduce average commute times by 15-20% for specific populations, particularly in underserved communities.

## Open Source

The core simulation engine is now open source, allowing other cities to adapt the methodology for their own transit planning challenges.
