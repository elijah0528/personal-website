# Hacker Fab: Building a Semiconductor Fab in My Apartment

When I started telling people I was building a semiconductor fabrication facility in my apartment, most thought I was joking. But here we are, several months later, with a working fab that can produce simple chips right from my living room.

## The Vision

The semiconductor industry has always fascinated me, but it's also one of the most inaccessible fields in technology. Traditional fabs cost billions of dollars and require massive cleanroom facilities. I wanted to democratize chip manufacturing and prove that you could build educational semiconductor processing equipment on a shoestring budget.

## The Challenge

Creating a fab in a residential space meant solving several impossible problems:

- **Space constraints**: Fitting professional equipment in 500 square feet
- **Contamination control**: Maintaining cleanliness without a proper cleanroom
- **Chemical safety**: Handling dangerous substances safely in a living space
- **Equipment costs**: Building tools that cost millions for under $10,000

## The Setup

### Photolithography Station

The heart of any fab is photolithography. I built a UV exposure system using:
- Modified camera lens for precise focusing
- UV LED arrays for exposure
- Custom alignment stage built from linear actuators
- Temperature-controlled substrate holder

### Chemical Processing

For etching and cleaning, I created a ventilated chemical station:
- Fume hood with active ventilation system
- Temperature-controlled acid baths
- Automated chemical handling to minimize exposure
- Emergency neutralization systems

### Deposition Equipment

For thin film deposition, I assembled:
- Vacuum chamber from modified pressure cooker
- Sputtering targets and magnetron assembly
- Thermal evaporation source
- Basic plasma cleaning capability

## Safety First

Working with semiconductor chemicals requires extreme caution:
- Full chemical ventilation system
- Emergency shower and eyewash station
- Proper chemical storage and disposal
- Fire suppression system
- Regular air quality monitoring

## Early Results

After months of debugging and process development, I successfully:
- Fabricated basic diodes and transistors
- Achieved feature sizes down to 10 micrometers
- Demonstrated basic IC functionality
- Processed over 100 test wafers

The yields are terrible and the devices are huge by modern standards, but they work!

## Process Flow

A typical chip fabrication process in my apartment fab:

1. **Substrate preparation**: Clean silicon wafers
2. **Oxidation**: Grow thin oxide layers
3. **Photolithography**: Pattern features using UV light
4. **Etching**: Remove unwanted material
5. **Deposition**: Add metal or semiconductor layers
6. **Testing**: Verify electrical functionality

## What I Learned

This project taught me more about semiconductors than any textbook:
- The incredible precision required for modern chips
- How process variation affects yield
- The importance of contamination control
- Why fabs cost so much to build and operate

## Democratizing Chip Manufacturing

The goal isn't to compete with TSMC, but to make semiconductor education accessible. I'm open-sourcing the designs and publishing build guides so others can create their own educational fabs.

## The Future

Next steps for Hacker Fab:
- Improve process control and yields
- Add more sophisticated processing capabilities
- Build a community of hobbyist chip makers
- Develop educational curricula around the platform

## Visit Waterloo Fab

You can learn more about this project and see it in action at [waterloofab.com](https://www.waterloofab.com/). We're also planning tours and workshops for anyone interested in hands-on semiconductor education.

## Safety Note

*This project involved extensive safety planning and should not be attempted without proper knowledge of chemical handling, ventilation systems, and emergency procedures. Always consult with safety professionals before working with semiconductor chemicals.*

Building a fab in my apartment proved that with creativity, determination, and proper safety measures, even the most capital-intensive technologies can be made accessible for education and experimentation.
