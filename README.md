### Elijah Kurien's Personal Website

![personal_website.png](public/personal_website.png)

Open-sourced my personal website. Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. When I was building my website it was hard to find good resources or inspiration for building a personal website. So I decided to open-source my website to help others who are starting out.

Please be creative and use this as a starting point. Don't copy it, but if you do, please attribute credit.
